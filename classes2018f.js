Metabolic engineering is a systems-oriented approach to the problem of remodeling and reconfiguring the many molecular components of the cell in order to achieve a desirable phenotype. Unlike molecule-centric approaches, which focus on only the final product-forming reaction, metabolic engineering emphasizes the metabolic pathway in its entirety. Course material analyzes cell-level processes as molecular systems. The processes to be discussed include: metabolism, protein synthesis, and regulation of gene expression. Analyses of these processes will emphasize an engineering, problem solving-oriented perspective, and will be integrated with discussions on core metabolic engineering methods: metabolic modeling, genetic engineering, and analytical biochemistry. Complementary disciplines very recently added to the metabolic engineering toolbox will also be discussed: ¿omics¿ technologies, computational systems biology, and synthetic biology. Selected metabolic engineering applications, including conversion of biomass into fuels, will be further explored through case studies and reviews of the current literature.\nRecommendations: Open to graduate students and seniors.

First, computer science is fundamentally concerned with the problem-solving methodologies it derives from its foundational fields: the design principles of engineering, mathematical theory, and scientific empirical study. Second, these methodologies are applied in the complex context of a modern day computing system. In this course we will address both of these important aspects. As a means for developing your design skills, we will discuss the fundamental features of a high level, general purpose programming language \u2014 namely C++ \u2014 and learn how to use it as a tool for problem solving. We will also consider the performance of solutions, and how to apply both analytical and empirical assessment techniques. Finally, we will explore the Unix operating system as a context for problem solving. (Additional weekly lab time scheduled at first class meeting.)\r\nRecommendations: High school algebra.

This course will introduce you to the logic behind this designation, through a careful and critical examination of the theory and research on children's mass media use, and the influence of media on children. We will explore the relationship between media use and developmental issues, discuss patterns of children's media consumption, and look at both the content and context of children's media, including television, films\/videos, advertising, games and websites. We will examine the empirical evidence that has attempted to assess the media's effects on children in a variety of areas, including gender and ethnic stereotyping, explicitly sexual and violent content in both entertainment and news, and also the educational or \"pro-social\" effects of media. We'll talk about the wall-to-wall advertising to which children are exposed, and look at the claims that advertising and media use have led to an increase in childhood obesity. And we will discuss the technologically saturated world of iPods, iPads, e-books, cell phones and computers that enable communication and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, to see what kinds of effects these technologies might be having on children at different developmental points. We will also critically assess the various regulations that have governed both advertising and programming for children in this country, talk about contemporary regulatory issues and how changes in media ownership rules might affect children's media content. We'll also discuss how technology such as TiVo, the television ratings system, voluntary Internet ratings system and access to the Internet affect children, pay some attention to the hot issue of cyberbullying, and will discuss the roles that parent and citizen activist groups play as watchdogs of children's media and the ways in which they can - and do - apply political pressure that results in change. For each topic we cover, we'll be looking both at the theoretical issues that undergird them, and also at the empirical ones that have attempted to assess, test or analyze them.The centerpiece of the class, however, will be your own work. You will have an opportunity to develop a proposal for a significant piece of research in an area of children and media that most interests you. It's my hope that this is research that you will subsequently carry out and ultimately publish, either as part of your MA or PhD program, or as a piece of applied research.","course_title":"Sem Child & Mass Media","showCourse":"Y","level1_groupid":"1085400010000000","comp_reqd_desc":"","hasHiddenClasses":"N","course_num":"CSHD-0267"},{"sections":[{"comp_desc":"Lecture","components":[{"unit_selected":3.0,"ssr_comp":"LEC","consent":"N","grd_desc":"GRD","assoc_class":"1","status":"O","section_num":"01-LEC","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"Regular","class_attr":"","selected":"","unit_min":3.0,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","class_num":"82890","locations":[{"instructor":"Richard M.

Art as Process is an intensive studio class that focuses on experimentation and the creative process rather than a pre-imagined or calculated end product. Each week a different project will be introduced, worked on and completed. We will explore painting, drawing, sculpture, installation and other disciplines and media with an eye toward investigating unique ways of making art. Abstraction, Realism and Conceptual approaches will be addressed and explored through a variety of hands-on projects. Individual and collaborative exercises will challenge students to broaden their awareness of personal and assimilated beliefs, conceptual ideas and autobiographical content through the use of metaphor, symbol and unconventional media. Class discussions, readings, presentations and field trips will supplement studio practice and look at art making in context of historical, cultural and contemporary issues. The interactive, participatory nature of Art as Process enables students coming from diverse areas of study to expand and enrich their perspectives of the broader community. Open to all, from absolute beginners to advanced artists, Art as Process is particularly useful for those interested in exploring and developing their own creative abilities, assembling a portfolio or exploring the idea of a professional art career.","course_title":"Art As Process","showCourse":"Y","level1_groupid":"1186400010000000","comp_reqd_desc":"","hasHiddenClasses":"N","course_num":"DRWM-0003"},{"sections":[{"comp_desc":"Studio","components":[{"unit_selected":4.0,"ssr_comp":"STU","consent":"N","grd_desc":"GRD","assoc_class":"1","status":"O","section_num":"01-STU","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"Regular","class_attr":"LA-Distribution-Arts|SoE-HASS-Arts|Studio Art","selected":"","unit_min":4.0,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","class_num":"82379","locations":[{"instructor":"Pauline Broman Wright","loc_id":"TBA","myLocUniqueId":"DRWM-00058237901-STUTBA","meetings":[{"meet_start_min":1140,"mtg_num":"1","days":["Tu","Th"],"meet_end":"10:00PM","meet_start":"7:00PM","meet_end_min":1320}],"campus":"Medford\/Somerville","class_loc":"TBA"}],"grd_basis":"GRD","showClass":"Y","component":"Studio","assoc_flag":"A","unit_max":4.0,"credit_select":"N","campus":"Medford\/Somerville"}]}],"acad_career":"ASEU","desc_long":"This course introduces both a way of seeing line, form and space and the basics of design through pen-drawn letters.

Perspectives will range from modernism's focus on the elements of art and principles of design to the postmodernism empasis on interdisciplinary approaches, cultural context and societal influences. Drawing from Wiggins & McTighe (2005), we will develop Essential Questions that stem from Enduring Understandings to bring meaning to content and skills in the art classroom.We will explore creative and worthwhile ideas and themes, choosing appropriate materials, visual resources, constructing sample products, and developing a personal teaching style. Students will work in cooperative groups to design a lesson plan bringing their individual talents and interests to the process. The cooperative groups will present their lesson plans to the whole class. Field work will require focused observation and participation in both museum settings and public school settings. Students will work with classroom teachers and also have the opportunity to participate in the Museum of Fine Arts's educational program. These dual settings will expand the students' exposure to different teaching styles, content, skills and environments.The class will also cover assessment strategies, classroom management issues, instruction strategies and organizational issues.

In addition to the conventional strategies used in narrative films of the past and present, special focus will be given to the radical experiments of Jean-Luc Godard, David Lynch, Orson Welles, Toru Takemitsu, Christian Marclay, Ryan Trecartin, Candice Breitz, and others. Practical audio techniques covered will include: digital audio recording devices, microphone selection and placement, audio editing software, dynamics control, equalization, noise reduction, workflow, mixing, and mastering. Small and large assignments will give students the opportunity to explore the strategies studied in the examples and to practice practical skills. The techniques and concepts covered in the class will be drawn from cinema, but are equally applicable to projects executed as video, installation, and image-for-sound.

This course will introduce you to the logic behind this designation, through a careful and critical examination of the theory and research on children's mass media use, and the influence of media on children. We will explore the relationship between media use and developmental issues, discuss patterns of children's media consumption, and look at both the content and context of children's media, including television, films\/videos, advertising, games and websites. We will examine the empirical evidence that has attempted to assess the media's effects on children in a variety of areas, including gender and ethnic stereotyping, explicitly sexual and violent content in both entertainment and news, and also the educational or \"pro-social\" effects of media. We'll talk about the wall-to-wall advertising to which children are exposed, and look at the claims that advertising and media use have led to an increase in childhood obesity. And we will discuss the technologically saturated world of iPods, iPads, e-books, cell phones and computers that enable communication and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, to see what kinds of effects these technologies might be having on children at different developmental points. We will also critically assess the various regulations that have governed both advertising and programming for children in this country, talk about contemporary regulatory issues and how changes in media ownership rules might affect children's media content. We'll also discuss how technology such as TiVo, the television ratings system, voluntary Internet ratings system and access to the Internet affect children, pay some attention to the hot issue of cyberbullying, and will discuss the roles that parent and citizen activist groups play as watchdogs of children's media and the ways in which they can - and do - apply political pressure that results in change. For each topic we cover, we'll be looking both at the theoretical issues that undergird them, and also at the empirical ones that have attempted to assess, test or analyze them.The centerpiece of the class, however, will be your own work.

You are encouraged to cross-pollinate your book works with information covered in other areas of study. In addition, you will learn paper mechanics (pop-up structures), historic photographic printmaking (aka \u201Csun printing\u201D: cyanotype and Van Dyke brown printing), and go on\nfield trips to rare book and artist\u2019s book collections. Essays on subjects such as mapping, identity, and surveillance\nprovide thoughtful bases for smaller books. The overriding concern is refining connections between content, sequencing, craft, and the use of appropriate materials\/bindings to underscore your message. Class meetings consist of demonstrations that elaborate on self-taught skills and\/or structures in Artist\u2019s Books: An Introduction, PowerPoint presentations on books from the Middle Ages to the present, open studio time, and discussions of work in progress.\n\nNon-SMFA students and MAT Art Education students will receive a letter grade.","course_title":"Artists' Books: A Hybrid","showCourse":"Y","level1_groupid":"1422020010000000","comp_reqd_desc":"","hasHiddenClasses":"N","course_num":"GRA-0182"},{"sections":[{"comp_desc":"Studio","components":[{"unit_selected":4.0,"ssr_comp":"STU","consent":"N","grd_desc":"PNP","assoc_class":"1","status":"O","section_num":"01-STU","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"Regular","class_attr":"Studio Art","selected":"","unit_min":4.0,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","class_num":"83781","locations":[{"instructor":"Chantal Zakari","loc_id":"TBA","myLocUniqueId":"GRA-01848378101-STUTBA","meetings":[{"meet_start_min":540,"mtg_num":"1","days":["Tu"],"meet_end":"12:00PM","meet_start":"9:00AM","meet_end_min":720},{"meet_start_min":840,"mtg_num":"2","days":["Tu"],"meet_end":"5:00PM","meet_start":"2:00PM","meet_end_min":1020}],"campus":"Fenway","class_loc":"TBA"}],"grd_basis":"PNP","showClass":"Y","component":"Studio","assoc_flag":"A","unit_max":4.0,"credit_select":"N","campus":"Fenway"}]}],"acad_career":"ASEU","desc_long":"In the tradition of activist artists, we will infiltrate the publishing industry with a mass produced artist\u2019s book.\n\nThis class begins by introducing students to the basics of publication design and progresses into developing a personal voice using the book as an art medium.

We will devise methods and techniques that rouse and animate the everyday, the intimate, the futuristic, and our alter-egos. Our cues will come from looking at international and historical approaches to puppetry including masks and puppets from Nigeria and Mali; automatons by Al-Jazari, Leonardo da Vinci, and Vaucanson; American slapstick and clowns; and Indonesian shadow puppets. We will also study artists and cultural producers that one might call contemporary puppeteers including the \u201CMardi Gras Indians\u201D from New Orleans, protest choreography by Black Lives Matter, artist Robin Rhodes, ventriloquist Willie Tyler and Lester, William Wegman and his Weimaraner\u2019s, Bread and Puppet Theater, and Taylor Mac.

Course participants will be immersed in this field of contemporary artistic thought and practice and, most importantly, will develop and produce personal work that signifies their own place and time.\nForms of personal and political testimony acknowledge the fraught histories of place, race, sexuality, and politics of the wider world, and acknowledge the clear and present dangers of our time. The class will include a discussion of readings, guest lectures, field trips, and gaining a broader understanding of how we are conditioned by the political and social climate.\nAs social media algorithms, bots, and ideologues wage a fierce political battle for control of hearts, minds, and personal capital, Witness: Art and Action will explore various layers of reality, including mass surveillance and marketing tools directed at changing how we think, which artists must contend with and unpack as they create their work. We will examine constructs that inform our understanding of our place in the world and influence our aesthetic choices, paying particular attention to the ways in which form creates meaning and content influences form. Will we use paint or pixels? Photographs or archives? Documentation of, or projection onto? Performance or action? Will we bear witness to what is, or imagine a new path? Truth or invention?\nStudio assignments are designed to explore the intimate relationship between art making and an artist's life, focusing on the practice and process of creating meaning through witness and experience.

With the exception of old growth forests that have been clear-cut for the production of large quantities of commercial papers, most plant material for papermaking is harvested, the plants themselves not killed. The earliest recorded paper (105 AD China) was actually made of recycled materials (fish nets, hemp waste, rags and bast fibers). Paper is the substrate for writing, printing, painting and other forms of communication. Its characteristics need to be compatible with the tools used. For example, paper made in the East tended to be thinner and more porous, appropriate for brush painting and calligraphy or block printing. Paper made in the West, needed to be durable enough to hold up to a quill pen or the pressures of a printing press. In addition to using raw plant materials, re-cycling plays an important part of paper production. For example, the first papers in Europe were made from rags that were collected and then \u2018beaten to a pulp\u2019 to make high quality papers. Re-cycling of paper continues today but one needs to balance the use of chemicals and energy in its production with the value of repurposing paper material. Additionally, there are many papermakers who are experimenting with invasive plants (Japanese knotweed, paper mulberry, mugwort). The focus of this course will be on the notion of sustainability. In particular, we will focus on what it means to \u2018re-purpose\u2019 materials, and place papermaking within this context. From harvesting plant materials, making papyrus from vegetables, to pulping old clothing, we will look at how papermaking historically began as a sustainable enterprise. An important part of this investigation will be looking at the work of contemporary artists who are re-purposing materials and addressing concerns about the natural world and the environmental impact of the choices we make. Some of the artists we will look at include Piero Gilardi, Tara Donovan, Aurora Robson, Kwang-Young Chun, El Anatsui, the Arte Povera movement. No previous papermaking experience is required.

Additional techniques will be introduced according to the ongoing needs and direction of the class.\n\nNon-SMFA students and MAT Art Education students will receive a letter grade.","course_title":"Woodcut\/Relief Printmaking","showCourse":"Y","level1_groupid":"1421980010000000","comp_reqd_desc":"","hasHiddenClasses":"N","course_num":"PRT-0174"},{"sections":[{"comp_desc":"Studio","components":[{"unit_selected":4.0,"ssr_comp":"STU","consent":"N","grd_desc":"CNC","assoc_class":"1","status":"O","section_num":"01-STU","class_stat":"A","session_desc":"Regular","class_attr":"BFA Studio Art|LA-Distribution-Arts|SoE-HASS-Arts|Studio Art","selected":"","unit_min":4.0,"enrl_cart_stat":"N","class_num":"82893","locations":[{"instructor":"John Schulz, William Peters Scott","loc_id":"TBA","myLocUniqueId":"PRT-01848289301-STUTBA","meetings":[{"meet_start_min":540,"mtg_num":"1","days":["Tu"],"meet_end":"12:00PM","meet_start":"9:00AM","meet_end_min":720},{"meet_start_min":840,"mtg_num":"2","days":["Tu"],"meet_end":"5:00PM","meet_start":"2:00PM","meet_end_min":1020}],"campus":"Fenway","class_loc":"TBA"}],"grd_basis":"CNC","showClass":"Y","component":"Studio","assoc_flag":"A","unit_max":4.0,"credit_select":"N","campus":"Fenway"}]}],"acad_career":"ASEU","desc_long":"This class will explore the dialogue between the direct mark of the drawn and the indirect mark of the print -- the two inform each other endlessly. We will focus on the directness of the process of drawing in facilitating and simplifying visual concepts for making prints, and draw on the indirect methods of printmaking to move toward new ways of thinking about making drawings. Various approaches to direct drawing, collage, frottage, woodcut and relief, collagraph, photocopy, and waterless lithography will be utilized.\nThe aim of this class is an open-ended, continuous process of exploration. There will be extensive emphasis on experimental techniques in various media or whatever it takes to help your developing visual ideas. If what you ultimately produce is neither clearly definable as a drawing or print, so be it. In this view, there is potential for the print matrix to become an endpoint, a part of the drawing itself.\nGroup critiques and individual consultations with both instructors will be ongoing throughout the semester. Contemporary and historical examples of the overlap and relationship of prints and drawings will be explored. This course can also be found listed under DRW 2027.

We discuss the work and ideas of class members in the context of broad issues such as the role and purpose of art making, the practice of art as a career, and the perspectives currently under discussion in art criticism and theory. Emphasis is on group collaboration and peer support for individual artistic development. To keep discussion groups small, faculty lead separate seminar sections.
